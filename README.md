# 🩺 AI Instant Chest X-Ray App

## 📑 Project Overview
This project uses **Deep Learning** to classify **Chest X-Ray images** and assist in detecting **Pneumonia** from medical images.  
The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically learn features from X-ray images and provide fast, reliable predictions.  

## 🎯 Features
- Upload a Chest X-Ray image and instantly get predictions.  
- Trained on a dataset of **Pneumonia** vs **Normal** X-rays.  
- Deployed using **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface.  
- Handles image preprocessing (resizing, normalization) automatically.
